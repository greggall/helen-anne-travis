          <p>
            Thanks for taking the time to tell me more about your content and
            copy goals. My head is already starting to spin with ideas on how I
            can help you achieve them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™ll be in touch within two business days to either set up a call or
            connect you with resources that I think will be helpful.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks again! Helen Anne</p>
